# Papers
Something
- This is a first time uploading a project here. It took quite a while but thankfully some indian dude saved me. The python project is the actual working rock, papers, scissors project. The "PApers" folder is the one that went from the game to some random motivational quote thing with some lyrics from "Savior" by Kendrick Lamar. Test folder is empty because its literally a test and RPSS is basically the same project but without the CSS and JS
