# Papers
Something
- This is a first time uploading a project here. It took quite a while to figure out how to upload it but thankfully some indian dude saved me. 
- # Disclaimer:
- The python project is the actual working rock, papers, scissors project.
- Test folder is empty because its literally a test and RPSS is basically the same project but without the CSS and JS 
- # Kendrick?
- The "PApers" folder is the one that went from the game to some random motivational quote thing with some lyrics from "Savior" by Kendrick Lamar.
